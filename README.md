## 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm **Leonardo**, a Computer Science student and web developer who enjoys building practical and meaningful software.  
I like transforming complex ideas into intuitive digital experiences — from full-stack web projects to tools that make daily life easier.

### 💻 What I Do
- **Web Development:** I build modern, responsive applications using **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, and **Next.js**.  
- **Automation & Bots:** I create systems and Discord bots that automate workflows and integrate APIs efficiently.  
- **Backend & APIs:** I focus on structured, maintainable backends using **Express**, always prioritizing clarity and performance.

### 📘 Currently Learning
`Java` • `Database Design` • `Japanese Language`

### 🎯 Goals
I’m focused on improving my technical skills and deepening my understanding of software design and system architecture.  
My goal is to create solutions that are both technically sound and truly useful in real-world contexts.

### 🌱 Beyond Code
Outside programming, I enjoy drawing, learning languages, and exploring creative ways to express ideas.  
I believe continuous learning and creativity are key to becoming a better engineer and communicator.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
`JavaScript` • `TypeScript` • `Node.js` • `Next.js` • `HTML` • `CSS` • `Express` • `Git`
