## 👋 About Me

Hi there! I'm **Leonardo**, a Computer Science student and passionate developer who loves creating meaningful digital experiences.  
I enjoy transforming complex ideas into intuitive, accessible solutions — from web applications to community-driven tools.

### 💻 What I Do
- **Web Development:** I build modern, responsive web apps using **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, and **Next.js**.  
- **Automation & Bots:** I’ve developed systems and Discord bots that streamline tasks, improve engagement, and integrate with APIs.  
- **Backend & APIs:** I design and maintain structured, efficient backends with **Express** and data-focused logic.

### 🎯 Current Focus
I'm currently focused on refining my development workflow and building projects that connect people through technology.  
My goal is to create software that’s both technically solid and genuinely useful in real-world contexts.

### 🌱 Beyond Code
Outside programming, I enjoy anime, drawing, and exploring languages and cultures — especially Japanese.  
I see creativity as a bridge between art and logic, and I believe both are essential in great software design.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
`JavaScript` • `TypeScript` • `Node.js` • `Next.js` • `HTML` • `CSS` • `Express` • `Oceanic.js` • `Git`
