## 👋 About Me

Hi there! I'm **Leonardo**, a Computer Science student and passionate developer who loves building things that connect people and ideas.  
I enjoy turning complex concepts into intuitive experiences — whether through web apps, Discord bots, or data-driven projects.

### 💻 What I Do
- **Web Development:** I work with modern tools like **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, and **Next.js**, creating responsive and well-structured applications.  
- **Automation & Bots:** I’ve developed bots that integrate APIs, manage communities, and process real-time data efficiently.  


### 🎯 Current Focus
I'm currently working on projects that bridge **technology and language**, aiming to make cross-cultural communication more natural and accessible.  
In the long run, I want to contribute to research that combines **AI**, **linguistics**, and **human connection**.

### 🌱 Beyond Code
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me watching anime, sketching ideas, or refining my Japanese.  
I believe that creativity and logic go hand in hand — and the best software often comes from both.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
`JavaScript` • `TypeScript` • `Node.js` • `Next.js` • `HTML` • `CSS` • `Express` • `Git`
